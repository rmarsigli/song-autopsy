(I may be paranoid, but not an android)\n\nWhen I am king, you will be first against the wall\nWith your opinion which is of no consequence at all\nWhat's that? (I may be paranoid, but no android)\nWhat's that? (I may be paranoid, but no android)\n\nAmbition makes you look pretty ugly\nKicking and squealing Gucci little piggy\nYou don't remember, you don't remember\nWhy don't you remember my name?\nOff with his head, man, off with his head, man\nWhy don't you remember my name?\nI guess he does\n\nRain down, rain down\nCome on rain down on me\nFrom a great height\nFrom a great height, height\n\nRain down, rain down\nCome on rain down on me\nFrom a great height\nFrom a great height, height\n\nThat's it, sir\nYou're leaving\nThe crackle of pigskin\nThe dust and the screaming\nThe yuppies networking\nThe panic, the vomit\nThe panic, the vomit\nGod loves his children\nGod loves his children, yeah!"
