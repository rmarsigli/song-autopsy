# Lyrics Review and Analysis for Eu Era Um Lobisomem Juvenil, by Legião Urbana

In "Eu Era Um Lobisomem Juvenil," Renato Russo constructs a sprawling, neurosis-fueled diary entry that perfectly captures the "beast-like" awkwardness of coming of age. The title, borrowed from a 1957 B-movie, is repurposed here to describe not a physical transformation, but a psychological one—the terrifying moment when a young person realizes their internal world is fundamentally incompatible with the "normal" world outside. The narrator's admission that the "heart doesn't think" serves as a warning for the lyrical chaos that follows, where logical coherence is traded for raw, unfiltered sentiment. It is a cynical look at the human condition: we are creatures who want to fly but are burdened by the physical reality of having "feet on the ground," a friction that generates more heat than light.

The song’s brilliance lies in its groundedness, specifically its mention of the mundane failures of 1980s Brazilian infrastructure. By noting that "yesterday there was no water, the day before no power," Russo anchors his existential crisis in a very real, decaying suburban setting. This isn't the glamorous angst of a movie star; it’s the frustration of a kid sitting in the dark, listening to his neighbors cheer when the lights finally come back on. This juxtaposition of high-concept philosophical questioning ("I was the supreme judge") with the reality of a "bicho do mato" (a wild or shy creature) creates a unique brand of regional post-punk that feels lived-in and authentic. The narrator is so "worried about being worried" that he becomes paralyzed, a sentiment that resonates with anyone who has ever over-analyzed their way into a dead end.

The final movement of the song shifts into a repetitive, almost obsessive pledge of loyalty that borders on emotional blackmail. The relentless refrain of "Estarei aqui" (I will be here) acts as both a promise and a threat, the desperate clinging of someone who has nothing else to offer but their own presence. It is the anthem of the "juvenile werewolf" who has finally been tamed by the need for connection, even if that connection requires them to surrender the "key to their heart." The track survives its own melodrama because it is so painfully honest about the embarrassing, unpolished nature of young love and the desperate desire to be "only yours." It remains a landmark for those who find themselves lost in the "vendaval" (gale) of their own making, waiting for the wind to pass so they can finally figure out what they feel.

## Contextual Analysis

### Genre Considerations

As a key track in the Brazilian post-punk movement, it favors atmosphere and lyrical density over traditional verse-chorus-verse structures. The music acts as a hypnotic, slightly repetitive bed that allows the stream-of-consciousness lyrics to take center stage, mirroring the cyclical, obsessive nature of the thoughts being described.

### Artistic Intent

Renato Russo intended to create a safe space for the "misfits" of Brazilian society. By admitting his own social clumsiness and his status as a "bicho do mato," he provided a voice for a generation that felt alienated by the hyper-masculine or overly festive tropes of mainstream Brazilian culture at the time.

### Historical Context

Released in 1989, the song arrived during a period of massive political and economic instability in Brazil. The "missing water and power" were not just metaphors but literal realities for a population facing hyperinflation and failing public services. The song’s internal chaos reflects the external chaos of a nation trying to redefine itself after a long dictatorship.

## Comparative Positioning

Compared to the more direct, politically charged hits of Legião Urbana’s earlier career, "Eu Era Um Lobisomem Juvenil" is a deep dive into the subjective. While bands like Titãs were shouting at the system, Russo was looking in the mirror and seeing a monster he didn't recognize. It shares a spiritual DNA with the early works of Morrissey, celebrating the "charming man" who is actually quite miserable and socially paralyzed. It stands as one of the band's most intimate works, trading the arena-rock fist-pump for a lonely, late-night confession.
