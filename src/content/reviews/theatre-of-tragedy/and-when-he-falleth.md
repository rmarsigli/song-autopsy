# Lyrics Review and Analysis for And When He Falleth, by Theatre of Tragedy

Theatre of Tragedy’s "And When He Falleth" operates as a sprawling, theatrical meditation on the collapse of divine authority and the seductive pull of nihilistic despair. The lyrical framework cleverly intertwines the band’s original gothic poetry with extensive, unedited audio samples extracted directly from Roger Corman’s 1964 film *The Masque of the Red Death*. By forcing a dialogue between cinematic Satanism and the band's signature brand of romanticized misery, the text establishes a tense dichotomy between blind faith and brutal awakening. The recurring motif of the "blindfolded falcon" serves as a blunt but undeniably effective metaphor for religious indoctrination, suggesting that devotion is merely a byproduct of prolonged psychological subjugation. Ultimately, the song posits that the supposed "divine comedy" of human existence is little more than a cosmic joke played upon a gullible species by an absent or indifferent creator.

Within the mid-1990s gothic doom metal scene, bands were desperately seeking avenues to distinguish their brand of melancholy from the straightforward aggression of their death metal origins. "And When He Falleth" perfectly encapsulates this transitional era, a period where the genre leaned heavily into high melodrama and faux-Victorian aesthetics to project an aura of intellectual superiority. The decision to allocate nearly half of the track's runtime to Vincent Price's commanding cinematic dialogue is a staggering structural choice that essentially forces the band into the subservient role of a backing orchestra for a B-movie philosophical debate. While some critics might dismiss this reliance on external media as a crutch to pad out the runtime, it undeniably succeeds in conjuring the oppressive, aristocratic atmosphere that the European metal underground prized above all else. The lyrics themselves, though occasionally reading like an adolescent attempt at translating Edgar Allan Poe into Middle English, perfectly capture the zeitgeist of a subculture obsessed with decay, performative heresy, and sweeping gothic grandeur.

Evaluating the text decades after its conception requires a delicate balancing act, acknowledging both its pioneering spirit and its inherent campiness. The juxtaposition of harsh philosophical dialogue with archaic Shakespearean pastiche established a blueprint that countless subsequent symphonic and gothic metal acts would exhaust to the point of absolute parody. Today, the sheer volume of the spoken-word film samples feels undeniably self-indulgent, demanding a level of patience from the listener that modern, algorithm-driven song structures rarely tolerate. However, the biting cynicism of the core message—that the earth is held "fro hell away" not by divine grace, but by the sheer absurdity of the human condition—retains a sharp philosophical resonance. Even if the execution occasionally teeters dangerously on the edge of pretentious melodrama, the unapologetic ambition of the band's vision ensures that the song remains a definitive, if slightly weathered, artifact of a wildly theatrical era in heavy metal.

## Contextual Analysis

### Genre Considerations

Gothic doom metal heavily prioritizes atmosphere and theatricality over traditional verse-chorus structures. The integration of archaic Early Modern English and lengthy spoken-word samples is a hallmark of the genre's formative years, deliberately distancing the music from modern sensibilities.

### Artistic Intent

The core objective is to dismantle the concept of a benevolent deity through a lens of aristocratic pessimism. By contrasting the visceral realities of famine and war with the blind obedience of the faithful, the lyricists aim to portray religious devotion as an inherently humiliating submission.

### Historical Context

Released in 1996 on *Velvet Darkness They Fear*, the track surfaced during the pivotal "beauty and the beast" era of European gothic metal. It demonstrated the emerging trend of utilizing affordable studio technology to embed extensive multimedia samples, blurring the line between music and cinematic soundscape.

### Translation Notes

While penned entirely in English, the lyrics employ a highly synthetic, archaic dialect featuring terms like "garths" (gardens), "ere" (before), and "hither" (here). This linguistic posturing functions less as an accurate historical recreation and more as a stylized, gothic mood board meant to evoke an antiquarian dread.

## Comparative Positioning

Compared to its immediate contemporaries, "And When He Falleth" wields its atmospheric weight like a blunt instrument rather than a subtle poetic device. While My Dying Bride’s "The Cry of Mankind" achieves a pervasive sense of dreadful melancholy through repetitive, hypnotic musicality and deeply personal lyricism, Theatre of Tragedy opts for an aggressively externalized, theatrical approach. The song proves far stronger in its overarching conceptual execution than much of Cradle of Filth's mid-90s gothic output, largely because it anchors its excess to a coherent philosophical argument regarding the death of God rather than mere shock value. However, it remains arguably weaker than the foundational bleakness of Paradise Lost's *Gothic*, as Theatre of Tragedy's profound reliance on Vincent Price's film dialogue occasionally dilutes the band's own lyrical voice, making the composition feel dangerously close to an audio collage rather than an original piece of literature.
